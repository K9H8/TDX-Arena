Instructions for Extracting JPEG Files from a Binary File

1. Locate the Large File in the Case Tab

Open your analysis tool and navigate to the Case tab.
Find and select the large binary file you need to examine.

2. Find the Indexes of Each FFD8 Occurrence

Write a script (e.g., in Python) to read the binary file.
Search for all instances of b'\xFF\xD8' (the JPEG Start of Image marker).
Record the positions (indexes) where they occur.

3. Save the Data into Separate Files

For each FFD8 index, store the data in a new file with '*.jpg'.


Summary
By locating the FFD8 and FFD9 markers, 
you can extract each JPEG file embedded within the large binary file.
